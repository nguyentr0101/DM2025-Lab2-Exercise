    "The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",

      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the discovered knowledge into practice. This could involve integrating it into business processes, creating reports, or building predictive models.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Data Mining Techniques:**\n",

      "Data mining employs a variety of techniques, often drawing from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Some of the most common include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
      "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",

      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n",

      "Data Centers \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Key Components \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Purpose \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Data centers serve as the central hub for data storage, processing, and management, enabling businesses to run applications, host websites, and manage their digital operations. \n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

      "His style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \n",
      "face, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \n",
      "example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n",
      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",
      "travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n",
      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",
      "bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \n",
      "watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

It contains and is structurally similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It is described as being more complex than LDL and includes other lipoproteins in its composition.\n*   **Cholesterol Deposition:** Like LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) deposits cholesterol in the arteries and can be found in plaque.\n*   **Location in the Body:** Lp(a) is found in cells that line small blood vessels and in tissues where regeneration and healing occur.\n*   **Potential Harmful Features:** Lp(a) appears to have all the \"bad features\" of LDL cholesterol, along with additional harmful features that are not fully understood.\n*   **Pro-clotting Activity:** Lp(a) acts as a molecule that supports clotting.\n*   **Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor:** Elevated Lp(a) levels are linked to a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke, irregular heart rhythms, heart valve disease, and limited lower-body circulation.\n*   **Association with Inflammation:** Lp(a) has been linked to inflammation.\n*   **Genetic Influence:** Genetic studies have shown that variations in the LPA gene can increase the risk of having elevated Lp(a) levels.\n*   **Prevalence:** Approximately 20-30% of people worldwide have elevated Lp(a) levels.\n*   **Uncertain Physiological Function:** It is currently unknown whether Lp(a) has a physiological function or if it is simply an evolutionary anomaly that has become common."

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
